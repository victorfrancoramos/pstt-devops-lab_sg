# pstt-devops-lab

This code will be used for one of the full demonstration labs for "PSTT - DevOps" and it intends to demonstrate the joint use of several technologies as covered in the training (In this particular example: Object Storage, Ansible and Python).

NOTE: This GIT repository is forked from hashbangbinbash/storagegrid-workshop. Al credit goes to Neil Morris for the code. I sincerelly thank him for letting me reuse a part of the "Partner Enablement workshop for StorageGRID Integration with 11.4". If you like this, I recommend to attend to his full delivery, as there is a lot more to enjoy there!

Neil designed this repository as public and is free to use for colleagues. If you plan to reuse the code, please lem him know beforehand at hashbangbinbash.
